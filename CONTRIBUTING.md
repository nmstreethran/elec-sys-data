Tips:

- Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes and keep them simple and small. If possible, squash your commits.
- Try to share how your code has been tested before submitting a pull request.
- If your pull request resolves an issue, include **closes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>** in your commit message.
- Review:
  - If your pull request is ready for review, another contributor will be assigned to review your pull request.
  - The reviewer will accept or comment on the pull request.
  - If needed address the comments left by the reviewer. Once you're ready to continue the review, ping the reviewer in a comment.
