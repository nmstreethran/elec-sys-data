## Installing dependencies

Running scripts and building the documentation locally require a clone of this repository and installation of [Python 3](https://www.python.org/).

First, clone this repository via either HTTPS or SSH:

```sh
# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/nmstreethran/ml-elec-model.git

# SSH
git clone git@github.com:nmstreethran/ml-elec-model.git
```

Then, create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```sh
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Alternatively, if using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual):

```sh
conda create --name ml-elec-model python=3
conda activate ml-elec-model
```

Finally, install the dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If using Anaconda, the required packages can alternatively be installed via [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), instead of using `pip install`:

```sh
conda install --channel conda-forge --file requirements.txt
```

To view the full list of dependencies, see [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).

## Documentation

The documentation is built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and hosted using [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org). It is available at <https://ml-elec-model.rtfd.io>. The files can be found in the `docs` folder.

To build the documentation locally, clone this repository and install all requirements. Local builds of the documentation in HTML format can be viewed in `docs/_build/html/index.html` after running the following in the `docs` directory:

```sh
make html
```

A list of references used is available on [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2327899/ml-elec-model/library).
