## Installing dependencies

Running scripts and building the documentation locally require [Python 3](https://www.python.org/).

First, create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```sh
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Alternatively, if using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual):

```sh
conda create --name ml-elec-model python=3
conda activate ml-elec-model
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If using Anaconda, the required packages can alternatively be installed via [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) instead of `pip install`:

```sh
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
conda install bokeh geopandas sphinx_rtd_theme entsoe-py
```

## Documentation

The documentation is maintained in this repository's [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/nmstreethran/ml-elec-model/wiki), built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), and hosted using [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org). It is available at <https://ml-elec-model.rtfd.io>. The files can be found in the `docs` folder.

To build the documentation locally, clone this repository and install a TeX distribution (such as [TeX Live](http://tug.org/texlive/)).

<!-- 
The GitHub wiki has been included in this repository as a submodule. All changes must be made to the files within this submodule (i.e., the `wiki` directory). Once changes are made, the following bash script must be executed to compile the documentation:

```sh
bash docs.sh
```

Then, commit and push all changes to the wiki's branch. Finally, commit and push to the main repository's branch.
 -->
Local builds of the documentation in HTML and PDF formats can be viewed after running the following bash script by opening `docs/_build/html/index.html` and `docs/_build/latex/ml-elec-model.pdf` respectively:

```sh
bash docs.sh
```

A list of references used is available on [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2327899/ml-elec-model/library).
