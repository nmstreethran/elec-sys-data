Documentation
-------------

The documentation is maintained in this repository's `GitHub Wiki <https://github.com/nmstreethran/ml-elec-model/wiki>`__ and built using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`__ and `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org>`__. It is available at https://ml-elec-model.rtfd.io. The files can be found in the ``docs`` folder.

To build the documentation locally, clone this repository (including submodules) and install a TeX distribution (such as `TeX Live <http://tug.org/texlive/>`__). Then, install the required Sphinx Python packages as follows:

.. code:: sh

    pip install sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme

The GitHub wiki has been included in this repository as a submodule. All changes must be made to the files within this submodule (i.e., the ``wiki`` directory). Once changes are made, the following bash script must be executed to compile the documentation:

.. code:: sh

    bash docs.sh

Then, commit and push all changes to the wiki's branch. Finally, commit and push to the main repository's branch.

Local builds of the documentation in HTML and PDF formats can be viewed after running the above bash script by opening ``docs/_build/html/index.html`` and ``docs/_build/latex/ml-elec-model.pdf`` respectively.

A list of references used is available on `Zotero <https://www.zotero.org/groups/2327899/ml-elec-model/library>`__.
