Energy system modelling
=======================

Energy systems models are tools used to project the future energy supply of a country or region [Herbst2012]_. The figure below explains the energy systems modelling process using a system analysis approach [Krook-Riekkola2015]_. This process starts with creating a model of the actual energy system by simplifying and conceptualising the present system. This conceptualised system with all assumptions is then mathematically solved to produce numerical results. These results can then be interpreted and conclusions can be drawn regarding the future energy system. Such conclusions form the evidence-base for decision makers, resulting in policy implications that help achieve these climate targets. This same approach can be used to explain various decision making processes for an energy system at various scales, other than policy making, as energy systems exist in different resolutions and levels of uncertainty.

Decision making at various resolutions
--------------------------------------

The figure below represents the different scales of energy systems, mainly in terms of temporal resolution, but also uncertainty and spatial resolution [Glismann2018]_, [Pfenninger2014]_. Temporally, "real-time" is referred to as the time of dispatch. It can be observed that the operational planning scale has high spatial and temporal resolution, and relatively low uncertainty. Operational planning includes dispatch planning and plant scheduling, which ranges from a few minutes to a week before dispatch. Maintenance planning can take a few weeks to years, as it involves upgrade and maintenance work which may require shut-down of units or assets, in turn affecting the availability of generation units and grid infrastructure. Adequacy assessments, which takes years, involve assessing the existing generation and storage capacities and planning for new installations based on demand projections, to ensure this demand will be met in the future. Finally, grid investment decisions, including planning transmission and distribution grid networks, cross-border and regional interconnections, and grid capacity expansions, take many years to decades and have very high uncertainty as a result.

Existing models and tools
-------------------------

Ringkjøb, et al. [Ringkjob2018]_ reviewed a comprehensive list of energy systems models for systems with large shares of :term:`VRE` generation. They have classified existing energy systems models based on the developer, software availability (i.e., open-source, commercial), software type (e.g., stand-alone, General Algebraic Modeling System (:term:`GAMS`)), purpose (e.g., power system analysis, scenario-based), modelling approach (bottom-up, top-down, hybrid), methodology (e.g., optimisation, simulation), temporal resolution, modelling horizon and spatial coverage. Additionally, information regarding the available conventional and renewable generation technologies, storage options, grid, demand sectors, demand elasticity, demand response, costs, market and emissions are provided.

Among the models listed by Ringkjøb, et al. are The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (:term:`TIMES`) and MARKet ALlocation (:term:`MARKAL`). The :term:`MARKAL` and :term:`TIMES` family of models, developed by the Energy Technology Systems Analysis Program (:term:`ETSAP`) of the International Energy Agency (:term:`IEA`), are bottom-up models that can generate economic models providing technology-rich basis for representing energy dynamics over a multi-period time horizon for local, national, multi-regional and global energy systems [IEA-ETSAP]_, [IEA-ETSAPa]_. Bottom-up models, also known as techno-economic or process-oriented models, have "relatively high degree of technological detail used to assess future energy demand and supply" and "use a business economics approach for the economic evaluation of the technologies simulated" [Herbst2012]_. :term:`ETSAP` reports that the :term:`MARKAL` and :term:`TIMES` models are being used by over 150 teams in 50 countries. Although widely used, these models focus on long time horizons and only perform a simplified supply and demand analysis for the electricity market and lack the detail to properly represent short-term fluctuations of :term:`VRE`, making them unsuitable for operational planning. Additionally, :term:`TIMES` was only recently (in January 2020) released under an open source GNU General Public License (:term:`GNU GPL`) [etsap-TIMES2020]_, but still requires the proprietary :term:`GAMS` language, solvers, and VEDA set of tools.

The methods used for forecasting in industry are commercial tools developed and maintained by energy consultancies, provide paid support to their customers. These models perform forecasting mainly using statistical and stochastic methods. Due to these tools being closed-source, no documentation or detailed information regarding these models are available publicly.

Transmission system operators (:term:`TSO`\s) make use of internal and commercial modelling tools when it comes to forecasting :term:`VRE` generation and demand. Example of commercial tools used for :term:`VRE` forecasting by :term:`TSO`\s in Great Britain include AWS Truepower, GH Forecaster (Garrad Hassan, now DNV-GL), PowerSight Wind Forecasting System (3Tier), Forecasting Tool (Element Energy) and Load Profile Modelling (Grid Scientific) [Hay2015]_.

AWS Truepower [UL]_ has a range of software for the operation of renewable energy projects, which includes access to time series measurements of wind and meteorological data at any time, a dashboard with visualisation of data, the ability to download data files, statistics and plot graphs, and support from the company’s consulting team.

DNV-GL's short-term energy forecasting service [DNV]_ is provided to wind and solar power plant operators. It is comprised of several forecasters, which has the ability to predict hourly wind and solar conditions up to 15 days in advance and update as quickly as every five minutes. The raw data can be provided in the plant operator’s choice of format. The service also includes interactive visualisation of data, both forecasts and historical measurements, and monthly reports and summaries.

Element Energy [ElementEnergy]_ is a specialist consultancy that has a load forecasting tool for identifying trends in future demand, generation and storage, as well as customer behaviour and technology deployment. Their forecasting model is of high resolution and is bottom-up. Apart from :term:`TSO`\s, distribution system operators (:term:`DSO`\s), also known as distribution network operators (:term:`DNO`\s), are also able to use this model for scenario-based cost-benefit analysis, as the grid flexibilities and smart grid services, including demand response and electric vehicle charging, are modelled in detail.

Grid Scientific [GridScientific]_ is a consultancy offering services related to information and communication technology and smart grids. No information regarding their Load Profile Modelling tool was available.
