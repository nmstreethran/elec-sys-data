The energy transition
---------------------

The transition towards a future low-carbon economy is driven globally by the Paris Agreement [UNFCCC2015]_, which recognises the need for sustainable development worldwide to counter the threats of climate change. The European Union (:term:`EU`\) is committed to reduce greenhouse gas (:term:`GHG`\) emissions by 2050 to 80-90 % below 1990 levels [EuropeanCommission2012]_. As the energy industry is responsible for the highest share of anthropogenic :term:`GHG`\  emissions [EuropeanCommission2012]_, importance is placed on how changes in energy systems can help achieve these :term:`GHG`\  emission reduction targets.

A number of opportunities exist for the decarbonisation of the energy industry. The International Renewable Energy Agency (:term:`IRENA`\), in their renewable energy roadmap study, has identified renewable energy as having the highest potential in reducing energy-related carbon dioxide emissions globally, which is closely followed by energy efficiency and electrification with renewable energy [IRENA2018]_. In a 2018 political agreement, the :term:`EU`\  member states agreed upon a target of at least 32 % of the demand being met with renewables by 2030, through national targets of the individual member states [EuropeanCommission]_. The electricity demand in the transport sector is also expected to increase due to expected petrol and diesel engine bans and subsequently the electrification of road transport [IEA2017]_.

Conventional energy resources, such as fossil fuels, biomass, hydro, geothermal, and nuclear fuels are non-variable. Fossil fuels, including coal, natural gas, and oil, as well as nuclear, are non-renewable. While nuclear, biomass, hydro, and geothermal energy are clean and/or renewable, generating power from fossil fuels or hydrocarbons involve combustion, which is a process that releases carbon dioxide and harmful by-products, such as soot. Fossil fuels are still extensively used and depended upon in industries around the world, including transport, chemicals, and power generation. As a result, the focus of the energy transition is to move away from fossil fuels to cleaner energy resources and technologies, including variable renewable energy (:term:`VRE`\) resources such as solar and wind. According to the :term:`EU`\  reference scenario 2016 [EUOpenData]_, wind and solar energy resources are expected to generate a total of 35 % of :term:`EU`\'s electricity by 2050, which is a significant increase (23 %) from 2015 levels. Conversely, generation from nuclear and solids, which are not variable and provide base load generation, are expected to decrease significantly.

While fossil fuels can be stored, transported, combusted, and converted into more useful forms of energy when there is a demand, generation from :term:`VRE`\  resources cannot be controlled to follow consumption patterns in the same way. :term:`VRE`\  resources are intermittent as they are dependent on atmospheric conditions, such as cloud cover and wind speed. They also have variations temporally (time-based) and spatially (location-based). This is a challenge to energy system operators, whose objective is to reliably and securely meet the energy needs at all times.

The energy system is also transitioning towards a decentralised system with more consumer participation and new forms of flexibilities, including sector coupling, demand-side management (:term:`DSM`\), energy conversion and storage, cross-border interconnection, and curtailment. This allows demand patterns to shift to better suit the generation patterns in systems with high penetration of :term:`VRE`\  resources [EliaGroup2018]_, such as solar and wind. This decentralised, flexible, and renewable energy system is more complex than traditional centralised systems, and require improved decision making processes for an optimal system operation. As the energy system is also becoming "smart" [Lund2017]_, the system will have an increasing amount of sensors and controllers that continuously record measurements of the system. Advancements in these technologies mean that data that is fast, heterogeneous and high in volume from the energy system will be generated [IBM2012]_. This provides an opportunity to exploit data with these characteristics to gain insights on the energy system, which can then be converted to strategies that optimise the system.
