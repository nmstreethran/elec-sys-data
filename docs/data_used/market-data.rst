Day-ahead market prices
-----------------------

In the :term:`ENTSO-E TP`, the day-ahead prices are published for each bidding zone at every market time unit, in the relevant currency per MWh. It is published no later than an hour after gate closure. In case of implicit allocation, the gate closure time is interpreted as the output time of the matching algorithms. The data is primarily owned and provided to the :term:`ENTSO-E TP` by power exchanges or :term:`TSO`\s. This dataset is available at hourly resolution.
