**Subject to change**

- Collect data from various sources for a particular period of time
- Select an area which has the most complete datasets for initial analysis
- Create initial visualisations and maps
- List all parameters available from the various datasets and perform a feature selection
- Map wind and solar power installations to meteorological stations and :term:`NUTS` data, and filter out irrelevant areas and stations
- Compare and label unavailable and withdrawn generation and production units
- Algorithm selection
- Adjust or normalise data (e.g., wind speed adjusted to turbine height)
- Forecast production and generation and compare with forecasts and actual values of generation, production, and weather conditions
- Expand to include load and market prices
- Compare algorithms and perform statistical analysis
- Propose improvements and perform analysis on other areas
- Propose a generalised solution and possibly standardise code
